################################################################################

This is a firmware for an odometer for a self driving toy car: the Donkey Car.

There are several different firmware programs in this project. They have
different features, and they are for different boards.

This firmware has the following properties:

* Written for an **Arduino Pro Mini** based circuit board.
* Uses four **single Hall sensors** as inputs, and counts their pulses. It can
  therefore not detect the direction of the rotation.
* Compiles with **Platform IO**.
